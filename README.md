# Weather-Tracker
Purpose: Get Accurate weather data to help you plan your weekend adventures! This weather app allows the user to search any city and get a current weather forecast and a 5 day forecast for that area. The current weather displays the name of the city, the current date, the temperature, humidity, and windspeed. The 5 day forecast displays the date, temperature, humidity, and windspeed. The app saves the city that was searched into local storage and creates a new button that the user can click if they want to see the weather forecast again for that city. There is a clear history button that will clear the display of the current city being searched. There is also a clear favorites button that will clear the saved cities from local storage.

Noteworthy Features: This app uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and a weather API from openweathermap.org ,  I created a variable URL for cityURL that will grab the latitude of longitude of the city that the user searches. I created a variable URL for queryURL that will use the latitude and longitude from each city that was searched and then be able to grab the daily forecast and the five day forecast for that area. I used the id that I created in my HTML for the Get Weather button to use it in my JavaScript. I created an event listener for this button. Once this button is clicked it will run the Get City function and then run the Get Weather function to display the current weather and the 5 day forecast. It will also create a button for the city searched and save it to local storage. There is an event listener on the city button that will display the weather again once clicked. I created a clear history button that will refresh the page so that the current weather will go away before searching for a new city. I created the clear favorites button to clear the saved city buttons from local storage if it starts to get to messy. I created multiple div tags in my HTML with specific ids and a weather container class in order to call those elements in my JavaScript. Once the Get Weather function is called, new elements are created to display the current weather and five day forecast in the HTML. I created the elements and appended them inside of the Get Weater function along with giving them specific styling.

I learned a lot during this project how to use a third party api and grab the specific data i want to display and how to make it display when i want to and look the way i want it to!
